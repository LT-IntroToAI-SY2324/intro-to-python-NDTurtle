# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
I like it and I think it's pretty intuitive. However there are some things that it's missing that java has, such as having more versatile for loops. 

2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
It's similar to java with all the datatypes, logic, etc, but the syntax is different. You don't have to put semicolons at the end of things and overall it's faster to code with python. However, I liked the logical approach of java where you declare variables and objects. 


3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
I learned how to do many of the things I knew how to do in java in python.
